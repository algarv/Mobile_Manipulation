Best: 
    Kp = 3
    Ki = 0
    max. speed = 10
    initial block position: (1,0)
    final block position: (0,-1)

    With one proportional controller, the arm follows a smooth path to the block without any overshoot, and replaces it
    at the designated spot. The proportional error steadily overcomes the error from the initial position
